Extract the location and a brief summary of what they are reporting.\n- "query": The user is asking for an update or summary of the latest reports at a location. Extract the location only.\n\nAlways respond in JSON format like this:\n{\n  "intent": "report" or "query",\n  "location": "location name",\n  "summary": "short description"  ‚Üê only for reports\n}\n\nBe concise and consistent.
